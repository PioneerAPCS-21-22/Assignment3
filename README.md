# Assignment 3

Create a program that takes temperature as input (using the `Scanner` class) and outputs the conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

Formula: **C = 5 / 9 * (F - 32)**

## Example Outputs

```
Enter the degrees in Fahrenheit: 85
85 F is equivalent to 29.444 C.
```

```
Enter the degrees in Fahrenheit: -22
-22 F is equivalent to -30 C.
```

### Challenge

If you are looking for a challenge, try to make a program that will do the conversion in either direction depending on what the user chooses. However, the challenge is to do this *without* using conditionals (`if` statements).

For example:

```
Enter the degrees: 27

<Ask the user if they want to convert from C to F or F to C>

The answer is: <answer>
```

### Grading

Your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style (following naming conventions for identifiers, proper indentation, and proper spacing). Also, remember to update the comment at the top of the file with your name and the date.
